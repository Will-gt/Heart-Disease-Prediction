## Heart Disease Prediction System

This project was developed as a part of the course 'Project management and tools for health informatics' at Stockholm University under the Global Master's in Health Informatics Programme. This programme was a joint collaboration between Karolinska Institutet and Stockholm University in Sweden. 

The aims of this course were to develop expertise to: 

• Explain basic project management methods 
• Be able to account for success factors in health informatics projects 
• Understand basic methods in the field of data mining 
• Explain process models for data mining projects 
• Explain how language technology methods can be used for analysis of clinical text 
• Explain the difference between rule-based methods and machine learning methods 

To develop skills and expertise to: 

• Apply basic project management methods 
• Work in an international multidisciplinary project group 
• Independent lead and implement a limited project in health informatics 
• Document the steps in the design of a prototype for a health information project 
• Apply the steps in a process model for data mining projects 
• Apply methods in the field of text mining to various types of health informational problems 

To conduct scientific study using appropriate evaluation techniques and: 

• Explain and argue for their positions regarding the implementation of a health information project 
• Explain how to work with sensitive health information in a safe and ethical manner

During this project, I worked in an multi-disciplinary group consisting of physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, biomedical scientists and software engineers to develop a heart prediction system using data from [UCI Machine Learning Repository] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease). This team-based project consisted of the following steps: 

1) Description of the data and understanding the features in the dataset
2) Data pre-processing (dealing with missing values, continuous to discrete values, dichotomize target variable, convert variables to factors and remove insignificant attributes)
3) Tested classifiers - (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayesian)
4) Selected optimal combination of datasets and trained using splitting criteria
5) Evaluated using the metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-Measure, AUC


The outcome of this project was a fully functional heart disease prediction system which was developed in R. The user interface to input the values for testing was developed using R Shiny. We were awarded a perfect A grade for this project with the feedback that the system we presented was one of the best in our class.
